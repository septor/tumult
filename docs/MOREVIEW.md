Or more information.

This, as described in the `about.md` file, is a personal project. It was written as a replacement for my Jekyll powered blog that I could personally expand on (because I know PHP and not Ruby).

The main differences between Tumult and Jekyll are that Tumult displays content on a single page. It's not designed to expand past the directory it's loaded in. It's very loosly based on [Pubwich](https://github.com/remi/pubwich) (which is no longer maintained). The things that are the same, I guess, are the ability (though not required) to manage your blog posts from a GitHub repository.

Expansion of services (which is how non-static content is fetched) will likely happen when my personal need calls for them. Or someone submits a pull request with one.
