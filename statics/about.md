## About

Tumult was written so that I could replace my "blog" powered by Jekyll with something I could personally modify without having to learn a new programming language and having to dedicate resources to a testing server to modify my changes.

While I am writing Tumult for my personal use, I welcome any ideas from anyone interested in using it. Throw an [issue](https://github.com/septor/tumult/issues/new) up on the repo and we'll get things going!
